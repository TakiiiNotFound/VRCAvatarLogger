# HOW IS IT WORKING  
basicly this script will scan your cache to get the avatar id, and will call the vrchat api to get the information and finally send the info to your discord server using webhook  
note - if an avatar is scanned it will not be scanned on the future utile you delete the AvatarScanned.txt
